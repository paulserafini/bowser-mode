 - The screen is refreshed before files are done deleting or unpacking; at the moment there is a 1 second pause before refreshing, but that won't work for large files
   - Use sentinels to check whether the process has finished?

 - Sort by file size, modified, etc.?
 - Mark and unmark all, invert marks?
 - Bind refresh?
